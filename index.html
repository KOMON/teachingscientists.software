          <p>
            Whether you're creating big-data ETL pipelines, detecting high-energy particles, or sequencing genomes, writing software has become more critical than ever for the working researcher.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, many scientists never receive formal training in software engineering, which can leave you feeling like you don't have the tools to build and maintain the software that you rely on for your results and insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Teaching Scientists Software</strong> aims to equip scientists with the skills that they need to build software that encourages collaboration, automates away time-sucking toil, and, most importantly, reduces risk of failure.
